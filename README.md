This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Data Aspiration

The goal is to host all primary sources of AhlulBayt Ahadith:

### Al-Kutub Al-Arb'ah- the Four books

1. Kitab al-Kafi of Kulayni (divided into Usul al-Kafi, Furu al-Kafi and Rawdat al-Kafi)
1. Man La Yahduruhu al-Faqih of Shaikh Saduq
1. Tahdhib al-Ahkam of Shaikh Tusi
1. al-Istibsar of Shaikh Tusi

### Primary Hadith Collection

(Primary Hadith books are those books which are collected, compiled and written by author or their students themselves).

1. The Book of Sulaym ibn Qays by Sulaym ibn Qays
1. Kitab ul Momin by Hussain bin Saeed Ahwazi
1. al-Mahasin by Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Barqi [Wikidata]
1. Al-Amali by Shaikh Tusi
1. Al-Amali of Shaikh Saduq
1. Al Tawheed (Saduq) [Wikidata] of Shaikh Saduq
1. Uyun Akhbar al-Ridha by Shaykh Saduq
1. Tuhaf al-Uqul by Ibn Shuba Harrani [Wikidata]
1. Al-Amali by Shaikh Mufid
1. Nahj al-Balaghah by Al-Sharif al-Radi
1. Khasais of Al Aemmah by Al-Sharif al-Radi
1. Daim al-Islam by Al-Qadi al-Nu'man
1. Al-Ihtijaj by Abu Mansur Ahmad Tabrisi [Wikidata]
1. Kamil al-Ziyarat by Ibn Qulawayh
1. Al Saqib Fi al-Manâqib by Ibn Hamaza Tusi
1. Basâ'ir al-darajât by Sheikh Al-Safar al-Qummi [Wikidata]
1. Al Ghaybah by Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Jafar al-Numani
1. Al Ghaybah of Al Tusi by Shaykh Tusi

## Improvements

1. Column headings are not aligned with the hadith index/count numbers
1. Heading tooltip
1. Comment section
1. SubChapters in chapter-list component, so that we can for example show that Al-Kafi Volume 4 Book 3's chapters 106 to 115 belong to "Chapters on Hunting" and chapters 213 onwards belong to a subchapter on "Chapters on Ziyarat" rather than its own volume! Some suggestions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52217179/angular-material-mat-table-row-grouping) for grouping rows but that makes sorting complicated, so not sure if and how we should fix this.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
