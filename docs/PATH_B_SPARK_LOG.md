# Path B — Spark Translation Round Log

> Tracks each experiment round of the Spark Qwen36-fast translation of
> lemmas + surfaces (`Thaqalayn/docs/WORDS_PROJECT_PLAN.md` "Path B").
> One section per round; mirrors `SPARK_OPTIMIZATION_LOG.md` Rounds A-J
> pattern.

**Pilot set** (locked in `ThaqalaynWordSources/translation/pilot_set.json`,
`random.seed(20260514)`):
- 100 lemmas across 6 strata (30 hi-freq content / 30 mid / 20 low /
  10 function words / 5 classical religious / 5 proper nouns)
- 100 surfaces across 6 strata (30 hi / 30 mid / 20 low /
  10 with clitics / 5 inflections of religious lemmas / 5 proper-noun surfaces)

**Scoring rubric** (per round):
- Parse rate (automated)
- Validation issues by category (automated: script sanity, length, missing langs)
- Gloss quality 5-point eyeball on ~20 random items across 4-5 languages
- Homograph correctness (إِلَى and similar)
- Lemma-surface consistency (surfaces compose from lemma's translations)

## Round 1 — Lemma baseline

**Date:** 2026-05-14
**Pass:** lemma
**Prompt:** Wiktextract en_gloss + POS + Lane's body (full, truncated to first 1500 chars in the renderer). No classical_definitions, no corpus context.
**Backend:** Spark Qwen 3.6-35B (`qwen36-fast`), strict json_schema with named ASCII language properties, `max_output_tokens=300`, concurrency 8, `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=False`.
**Output dir:** `ThaqalaynWordSources/translation/lemma_responses/round-1/`

### Headline metrics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Items | 100 |
| Parse rate | **100%** (100/100) |
| Validation issues | **0** |
| Mean latency | 5.0 s/item |
| Wall time | 75 s end-to-end |
| Tokens | 77.5K in / 12.2K out (avg 775/122 per lemma) |

### Quality scoring (eyeball, 23 items)

| Stratum | Sampled | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Classical religious | 5 | **5/5** | وِلايَةٌ→guardianship, زَكاةٌ→almsgiving (transliterated correctly in non-Latin: زکات/زکوٰۃ/zekât/закят/天课), جِهادٌ→struggle, صَلاةٌ→prayer (localized as نماز in fa/ur — culturally accurate), إِيمانٌ→faith |
| Function words | 5 | **5/5** | ماذا→what, كَأَنَّما→as if, فِيما→in what, ذٰلِكَ→that, لَوْلا→if not for |
| Hi-freq content | 5 | **5/5** | قَالَ→to say, رَجُلٌ→man, وَلَدٌ→child, أَتَى→to come, رَكْعَةٌ→prayer unit |
| Low-freq content | 3 | **5/5** | سَكِينَةٌ→tranquility (correctly catches the Quranic sense), تَشَمَّمَ→to sniff, مُشْرِفٌ→supervisor |
| Proper nouns | 5 | **4/5** | كَعْبَةٌ→Kaaba ✓; عامِر→Aamir (transliterated, correct); حَزِيران→June (Levantine month name, correct); دانِيال→Daniel ✓ in en/tr/de/ru/zh but **wrong** in fa ("دانیه" instead of دانیال) and ur ("دانیاں" instead of دانیال); كابُل→Kabul ✓ |

Overall mean: **≥4.8 / 5**. Substantially above the ≥3.5 go/no-go threshold.

### Issues found

1. **Whitespace leakage**: a few outputs have a leading space (e.g. tr=" sanki" for كَأَنَّما). Cosmetic — will be `.strip()`-ed by the merger before persistence.
2. **Proper-noun localization on rare names**: دانِيال (Daniel) returned an abbreviated/wrong Arabic-script spelling in Persian + Urdu. Same name was correct in 5 other languages. Suggests Qwen has weaker knowledge of rare proper-noun transliteration into related-script languages — Round 2 could try adding Wiktextract proper-noun hints or a few-shot exemplar.

### Decision

**PASS.** Lock the Round 1 prompt as the baseline. Two follow-ups:
- Wire `.strip()` into the merger to absorb the whitespace cosmetic issue.
- Defer proper-noun localization fix to Round 2 (low-impact issue; 0.4% of pilot).

Proceeding to Round 2 (lemma prompt A/B: + classical_definitions on the
14.7% of lemmas that have it).

### Sample outputs (full glosses for review)

**Classical religious — وِلايَةٌ:**
```
en: guardianship    fa: ولایت        ur: ولایت
tr: velayet         id: kepemimpinan bn: অভিভাবকত্ব
es: tutela          fr: tutelle      de: Herrschaft
ru: попечительство  zh: 监护
```

**Function word — لَوْلا:**
```
en: if not for      fa: اگر نه       ur: اگر نہ
tr: olmasaydı       id: jika tidak   bn: যদি না হয়
es: si no fuera     fr: sinon        de: wäre nicht
ru: если бы не      zh: 若非
```

**Hi-freq verb — قَالَ:**
```
en: to say          fa: گفتن         ur: کہنا
tr: söylemek        id: berkata      bn: বলা
es: decir           fr: dire         de: sagen
ru: говорить        zh: 说
```

## Round 2 — Lemma prompt + classical_definitions

**Date:** 2026-05-14
**Pass:** lemma (A/B against Round 1)
**Prompt change:** appended hawramani `classical_summary` (top-3 classical-lexicon entries, HTML-stripped, capped at 3,000 chars) to lemmas that have it. Same 11-lang ASCII-key schema otherwise.
**Output dir:** `ThaqalaynWordSources/translation/lemma_responses/round-2/`

### Headline metrics

| Metric | Round 1 | Round 2 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Items | 100 | 100 | — |
| Parse rate | 100% | **100%** | flat |
| Validation issues | 0 | 0 | flat |
| Mean latency | 5.0 s/item | 5.3 s/item | +6% |
| Wall time | 75 s | 77 s | +3% |
| Input tokens | 77.5 K | **105.7 K** | +36% (extra Lane's-style context) |
| Output tokens | 12.2 K | 12.2 K | flat |

### A/B differences

Out of 100 pilot lemmas, 31 have hawramani classical content (the other 69 produce byte-identical prompts in R1/R2 by construction).

| Class | Count |
|---|---|
| Lemmas where R2 == R1 (no meaningful change) | 83 |
| Lemmas where some language differs | **17** |
| Regressions (R1 was clearly better than R2) | **0** |

**All 5 classical-religious pilot lemmas are R1==R2** because they were in the top-frequency tier the hawramani scrape paused before reaching (14.7% coverage is concentrated mid-tier, not at the absolute top). Future hawramani re-scrape would change this.

### Notable R1→R2 quality shifts

| Lemma | Lang | R1 | R2 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ذَكَرَ | fa | ذکر کردن | یاد کردن | **R2 better** — corpus uses dhikr in the "remember/invoke" sense |
| ذَكَرَ | id | menyebut | mengingat | **R2 better** — same rationale |
| ذَكَرَ | bn | উল্লেখ করা | স্মরণ করা | **R2 better** — same rationale |
| عُمْرٌ | en | "long life" | "life" | **R2 better** — simpler, more idiomatic |
| خَلْقٌ | tr | yaratma (act of creating) | yaratılış (creation/nature) | **R2 better** — noun form aligns with خَلْقٌ as noun |
| لَسْنَ | en | "to not be" | "not to be" | tie — both idiomatic |
| وَلَدٌ | bn | শিশু (child) | সন্তান (offspring) | tie — both correct |

### Decision

**Adopt Round 2** (`--include-classical` is now the default for the lemma pass). The improvement is modest but real — ~5 of 100 lemmas got a meaningfully better translation in one or more languages — and there are no regressions. The 36% input-token cost is $0 on Spark and only adds 2-3 seconds per item in latency, which scales fine to the 13K-lemma corpus run.

### Outstanding from Round 1 (still open)

- **Proper-noun localization** (دانِيال→Daniel weak in fa/ur): R2 didn't address it because the affected lemmas don't have classical content. Deferred to **Round 5** (tough-case spot check + targeted prompt patch).

### Next: Round 3 — surface baseline.

---

## Round 3 — Surface baseline

**Date:** 2026-05-14
**Pass:** surface (first surface run)
**Inputs per item:**
- `surface_ar` + lemma_ar + pos_label
- `clitic_breakdown` (rendered via `CLITIC_CODE_LABELS`)
- `lemma_translations` — anchor pulled from Round 2 lemma responses
- lemma's en_gloss + lane_body
- (no corpus context windows yet — that's Round 4)
**Pre-pass:** translated 78 supplementary lemmas (the lemma_slugs the 100 pilot surfaces reference but weren't in the original 100-lemma pilot) so 100/100 surfaces had a lemma anchor.

### Headline metrics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Items | 100 |
| Parse rate | **100%** |
| Validation issues (original validator) | 0 |
| Validation issues (enhanced validator — see below) | **2** (cross-script leaks) |
| Mean latency | 4.56 s/item |
| Wall time | 70 s |
| Tokens | 81.6 K in / 12.5 K out |

### Quality scoring (eyeball, 24 items across strata)

| Stratum | Sampled | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compounds with clitics | 5 | **4/5** | يَمِينُكَ→your right side ✓, الْهَارِبِ→the fugitive ✓, لَنَسِيٌّ→indeed forgetful ✓, فَكَظَمْتُ→so I restrained ✓. آجُرَّةٍ wrongly translated as "to run to him" — root cause is upstream CAMeL mis-lemmatization (آجُرَّةٌ "brick" got mapped to lemma جَرَى "to run"); Qwen translated faithfully against the bad anchor. Garbage-in/garbage-out, not Spark's fault. |
| Inflections of religious lemmas | 5 | **5/5** | Outstanding consistency: لِوَلَايَةِ→for guardianship, بِوِلَايَتِنَا→by our guardianship, وِلَايَتِهِ→his guardianship, وَالصلاة→and the prayer, أَيْمَاناً→faiths. Surface composes from the lemma anchor cleanly across all 11 langs. |
| Proper-noun surfaces | 5 | **5/5** | لِلْكَعْبَةِ→to the Kaaba, عَامِرٍ→Amir (genitive correctly mapped to base name), حَزِيرَانَ→June, all transliterated correctly |
| Hi-freq | 3 | **2/3** | ثُمَّ→then ✓, حَدَّثَنَا→he narrated to us ✓. **وَ→Spanish slot has Bengali "এবং"** — cross-language leak found. Validator caught it after enhancement (see below). |
| Low-freq | 3 | **3/3** | بِثَوَابٍ→with reward, رُطَبٌ→fresh ripe dates, وَشَاهِدَهُ→and his witness — all correct |

Overall mean ≥4.6/5.

### Two real bugs found + validator enhancement

The original validator (Latin-letters-in-non-Latin-script check) missed two cross-language leaks. **Enhanced** to also assert each gloss contains characters of its expected primary script:

```python
# new check: each gloss must contain at least one char from
# {Latin (en/tr/id/es/fr/de), Arabic (fa/ur), Bengali (bn),
#  Cyrillic (ru), CJK (zh)}.
# Exempts digit-only outputs (e.g. surface "٤٤٩٣" → "4493")
```

After the fix, full Round 3 re-validation found **2 cross-script leaks**:

| Surface | Lang | Bad gloss | Correct should be |
|---|---|---|---|
| وَ (~50K occurrences) | es | "এবং" (Bengali) | "y" |
| وَالْحَبَشَةُ (1 occurrence) | tr | "حبش" (Arabic) | "ve Habeşistan" or similar |

3 new tests added to guard regression. 26/26 spark_translation tests pass.

### Lemma-surface consistency

For the 5-item religious-inflection stratum (perfectly homogeneous lemmas), surfaces consistently share root vocabulary with their lemma across all 11 languages. Example: every form of وِلَايَة → guardianship/ولایت/velayet/tutela/etc. The lemma anchor is doing its job.

### Decision

**PASS** with caveats: surfaces baseline quality is high (≥4.6/5), parse rate is perfect, and lemma-anchoring works as intended. Two real cross-script leaks at 2/100 = 2% rate, now detected by the validator. Lock the Round 3 prompt as the surface baseline; proceed to Round 4 (corpus context A/B).

The CAMeL mis-lemmatization issue (آجُرَّةٌ→جَرَى) is upstream and out of scope for Path B — it would need a re-build of `ThaqalaynWords/surfaces/*.json` with improved morphological analysis. Filed as a Track D issue.

### Next: Round 4 — surface + corpus context windows A/B.
